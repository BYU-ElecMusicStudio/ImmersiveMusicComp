## Spectrum of Focus/Detail/Texture

## Visual parity, corporeal AND figurative 
(coupling visual elements/concepts with spatiality)

## Soundscape as style AND as element 
(mundane composition, continuous, unchanging)

(spatial regions activating effects on nearby sounds). Could be discrete or continuous

## Behavior-based effects 
(effects based on speed, distance, proximity, energy, etc.).
