> Exploration of the use immersive audio in the film industry. 

## Film Experiment  
On February 7, we conducted an experiment to assess the impact of immersive audio on the film industry. We took a score for a five-minute action movie clip and divided the track into stems. Each stem was assigned to specific sources, and the L-ISA controller's 'snapshots' feature was utilized to trigger movement on the sources.
The final product was presented to a small group of three individuals to observe their reactions. When asked whether the immersive audio distracted from or enhanced the film, the participants unanimously agreed that it enhanced the viewing experience. They reported that it helped immerse them more deeply in the film.


## Balance and Mix
We observed that dividing the stems and assigning each a specific location significantly improved audio clarity, making the individual instruments more discernible. Furthermore, we found that changing the location of a soloistic instrument while it was playing drew attention to it without the need to amplify its audio levels to achieve the desired effect.

In the experiment, we explored symmetry by playing the same sound file from two sources aligned with each other and three sources equidistantly apart. However, we discovered that this symmetry was not very definable. Instead, playing the sources with a slight offset proved to be much more effective. For example, an orchestral setup typically positions brass on one side, violins on the other, and percussion at the back. Placing the sources in a similar 'lopsided configuration' feels much more natural to us.


## Movement
An integral part of the experiment involved synchronizing the movement of audio sources with the film's visual elements. For instance, as the protagonist rode his motorcycle around a roundabout, the audio sources rotated around the room at a speed corresponding to the camera angles. Additionally, we attempted to change the location of the sources quick during a crash scene but discovered that rapidly moving sources detracted from the film.


## Summary 
In summary, the experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of immersive audio in enhancing the viewer's experience. A static yet immersive configuration of the audio stems provided clearer sound quality compared to a traditional stereo mixdown. While moving the position of the sources created interesting effects that occasionally enhanced the immersive experience, in some cases, it proved distracting. Further research is required to determine the most effective techniques for immersing viewers into the film using this innovative technology.
