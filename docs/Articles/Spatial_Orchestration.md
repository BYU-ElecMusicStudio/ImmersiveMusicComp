## Immersive Composition: The Parker Probe
Immersive composition is a new novelty available to musicians. My classmates and I were all able to come up with ideas for compositions that would test different aspects. One of my contemporaries wanted to experiment with how immersive music would affect film. Would it be too distracting and pull the audience away from the movie? My other classmate wanted to add a new perspective to Webern’s symmetrical works. Would an audience be able to better map the symmetrical patterns and hear the tones if it was put in an immersive space? My idea for my project was to create an immersive planetarium where I immerse an audience in the sound of the Parker Probe. The Parker Probe is the first NASA probe that has recorded data from the sun, more specifically, solar wind.

# Mixing

In order to accomplish my project idea, I put the same clip from the Parker Probe in seven different channels in the L-ISA controller. Four of which, I changed the pitch to a lower frequency. We discovered that the clips needed to be played at different times to avoid the apparent repetition of the loop. This repetition destroys the simulated atmosphere. In addition, we discovered that if the clips with the higher pitches are being played, the distance on those clips need to be increased, where as the lower frequency clips need to be as close as they can be, in order to better balance the mix. We decided to cut out the higher frequency clips entirely and focus on the low clips. We noticed that this was more effective in creating a realistic atmosphere, and we noticed that we could hear parts of the harmonic series. We then added reverb which made the atmosphere sound more artificial as compared to without reverb, where it sounds more real. 

For the work of my contemporaries, we similarly discovered that mixing plays a huge role on the overall experience. With the film project, we found that we couldn’t locate when and where the different instrument sections were moving if they were symmetrical to each other. However, if they were asymmetrical, it was easier to localize. With the Webern project, it was easy to localize the different pitches. However, it seemed random. There was not a discernable symmetrical shape to the composition as was intended.

# Spatial Orchestration

After all of our discoveries, we decided that instead of panning and making one sound move across a room, we want to have an evenly mixed experience that continually plays, but we manipulate the audience’s attention, by making one channel gradually louder. Making it stick out above the rest. We coined the term, “Spatial Orchestration”. This is now our biggest question. How do we orchestrate and immersive experience, that is more than just panning a sound around a room? In future experiments with my project, this is the goal.
